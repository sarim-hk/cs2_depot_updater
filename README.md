# [CS2] Depot Downloader
The python script will download and patch CS2 for you, given you have the required `.manifest` files.

## Prerequisites
While this tool makes the process of getting the game easier, there's still some work you need to do yourself:
- Python 3 must be installed.
- The three `.manifest` files you want to use should be in the main directory (alongside `main.py`), and only the three you want to use.

## Support
- Open an issue on GitHub.
- DM me on Twitter, [@hk_sarim](https://twitter.com/hk_sarim).
